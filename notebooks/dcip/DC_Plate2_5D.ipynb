    "# Purpose \n",
    "\n",
    "For a direct current resistivity (DCR) survey, currents are injected into the earth, and flow. \n",
    "Depending upon the subsurface conductivity structures current flow in the earth will be distorted and charges will accumulate on interfaces between regions of different conductivites. These changes can be measurable at the sufurface electrodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we focus on a plate target embedded in a halfspace, and investigate what is happening in the earth when static currents are injected. Different from the sphere case, which is symmetric, \"coupling\" between the Tx, target (conductor or resistor), and Rx will be significanlty different with various scenarios and geometries. \n",
    "Using this app we can investigate what effect different targets and survey geometries have on the currents, electric fields, potentials, charges, and sensitivities."
