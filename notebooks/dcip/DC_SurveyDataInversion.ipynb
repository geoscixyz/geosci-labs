For different electrode configurations you can measure the potential differences and see the calculated apparent resistivities. \n",

    "# 3. Building Pseudosections \n",

For pole-dipole or dipole-pole surveys the $45^{\\circ}$ line is simply extended from the location of the pole. By using this method of plotting, the long offset electrodes plot deeper than those with short offsets. This provides a rough idea of the region sampled by each data point, but the vertical axis of a pseudo-section is not a true depth.\n",

The blue dots then mark the location in the pseudo-section where the lines from Tx and Rx midpoints intersect and the data is plotted. By stepping through the Tx (current electrode pairs) using the slider you can see how the pseudo section is built up.\n",

    "# 4. Parametric Inversion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final widget you are able to forward model the apparent resistivity of a cylinder embedded in a two layered earth. Pseudo-sections of the apparent resistivity can be generated using dipole-dipole, pole-dipole, or dipole-pole arrays to see how survey geometry can distort the size, shape, and location of conductive bodies in a pseudo-section.  Due to distortion and artifacts present in pseudo-sections trying to interpret them directly is typically difficult and dangerous due to the risk of misinterpretation. Inverting the data to find a model which fits the observed data and is geologically reasonable should be standard practice.   \n",
    "\n",
    "By systematically varying the model parameters and comparing the plots of observed vs. predicted apparent resistivity a parametric inversion can be preformed by hand to find the \"best\" fitting model. Normalized data misfits, which provide a numerical measure of the difference between the observed and predicted data, are useful for quantifying how well and inversion model fits the observed data. The manual inversion process can be difficult and time consuming even with small examples sure as the one presented here. Therefore, numerical optimization algorithms are typically utilized to minimized the data misfit and a model objective function, which provides information about the model structure and complexity, in order to find an optimal solution.\n",
