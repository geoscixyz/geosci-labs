    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we show fields and fluxes that result from placing a harmonic vertical magnetic dipole (VMD) source over a layered Earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are [two commonly used models](https://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/dipole_sources_in_homogeneous_media/magnetic_dipole_definition/index.html) for describing a harmonic VMD source: 1) as an infinitessimally small bar magnet that experiences a harmonic magnetization in the vertical direction, and 2) as an infinitessimally small horizontal loop of wire carrying a harmonic current. In either case, the harmonic VMD creates a primary harmonic magnetic field in its viscinity; which is vertical at the location of the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "True dipole sources do not exist in nature however they can be approximated in practice. For geophysical applications, small wire loops carrying harmonic current are used to approximate harmonic VMD sources. These EM sources may be placed on the Earth's surface (ground-based surveys) or flown through the air (airborne surveys). Because the source's primary field is harmonic, it induces anomalous currents in the Earth. The distribution and strength of the induced currents depends on the frequency of the harmonic VMD source and the subsurface conductivity distribution. The induced current ultimately produce secondary magnetic fields which can be measured by one or more receivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this app, we explore the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does the frequency impact the fields and currents produced by the harmonic VMD source?\n",
    "- For a layered Earth, how does changing layer thickness and conductivity impact the fields and currents produced by the harmonic VMD source?\n",
    "- How does the frequency impact secondary fields measured above the Earth's surface?\n",
    "- For a layered Earth, how does changing layer thickness and conductivity impact secondary fields measured above the Earth's surface?"

    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The geological scenario being modeled is shown in the figure below. Here, we assume the Earth is comprised of 3 layers. Each layer can have a different electrical conductivity ($\\sigma$). However, a constant magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi$) is used for all layers; where $\\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space and $\\mu = \\mu_0 (1 +\\chi)$. The thicknesses of the top two layers are given by $h_1$ and $h_2$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a harmonic VMD source (*Tx*) is used to excite the Earth, and the Earth's FEM response (secondary magnetic field) is measured by a receiver (*Rx*). In practice, the transmitter and receiver may be placed near the Earth's surface or in the air. The source may also operate at a variety of frequencies. Because we are operating in the frequency domain, fields and currents within the region have both real and imaginary components.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the fields and currents resulting from a harmonic VMD source over a layered Earth we have two apps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields app:** Models the fields and currents everywhere at a particular frequency\n",
    "- **Data app:** Models the secondary magnetic field observed at the receiver as a function of frequency\n",

    "- **Q1:** Set $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ to arbitrary conductivity values. Based on the geometry of the problem, which components (x, y, z) of each field (E, B, Bsec or J) are zero? Run the *Fields app* and set *AmpDir = None*. Next, try different combinations of *Field* and *Comp*. Does the simulation match what you initially thought?\n",
    "\n",

Is the electric field in the Earth in phase or out of phase with the primary field? Why? *Hint: think about Faraday's law*.\n",

Set *Field = B*, *AmpDir = Direction*, *Re/Im = Re* and *f index = 1* for a vector plot of the primary magnetic field; since at low enough frequencies, the secondary field is negligible compared to the primary field. Now switch *Field = Bsec* and use *Re/Im* to answer the following:\n",
