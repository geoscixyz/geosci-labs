    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we show the transient fields and fluxes that result from placing a vertical magnetic dipole (VMD) source over a layered Earth. The transient response in this case refers to the fields and fluxes that are produced once a long-standing primary magnetic field is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [two commonly used models](https://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/dipole_sources_in_homogeneous_media/magnetic_dipole_time/index.html) for describing the VMD source that produces a transient response: 1) as an infinitessimally small bar magnet that experiences a long-standing vertical magnetization which is then instantaneously removed at $t=0$, and 2) as an infinitessimally small horizontal loop of wire carrying a constant current which is then instantaneously shut off at $t=0$ (step-off current waveform).\n",
    "\n",
    "True dipole sources do not exist in nature however they can be approximated in practice. For geophysical applications, we use small current loops to approximate transient VMD sources. These EM sources may be placed on the Earth's surface (ground-based surveys) or flown through the air (airborne surveys). According to the Biot-Savart law, a primary magnetic field is produced whenever there is current in the loop. When the current is shut-off, the sudden change in magnetic flux induces anomalous currents in the Earth which propagate and diffuse over time. The distribution and propagation of the induced currents depends on the subsurface conductivity distribution and how much time has passed since the current in the VMD source was shut off. The induced currents ultimately produce secondary magnetic fields which can be measured by a receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this app, we explore the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do the fields and currents produced by the transient VMD source change over time?\n",
    "- For a layered Earth, how does changing layer thickness and conductivity impact the fields and currents produced by the transient VMD source?\n",
    "- How do the secondary fields measured above the Earth's surface change over time?\n",
    "- For a layered Earth, how does changing layer thickness and conductivity impact secondary fields measured above the Earth's surface?"

    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The geological scenario being modeled is shown in the figure below. Here, we assume the Earth is comprised of 3 layers. Each layer can have a different electrical conductivity ($\\sigma$). However, a constant magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi$) is used for all layers; where $\\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space and $\\mu = \\mu_0 (1 +\\chi)$. The thicknesses of the top two layers are given by $h_1$ and $h_2$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a transient VMD source (*Tx*) is used to excite the Earth, and the Earth's TEM response (secondary magnetic field) is measured by a receiver (*Rx*). In practice, the transmitter and receiver may be placed near the Earth's surface or in the air. The receiver may also measure secondary fields at a variety of times after the source is shut off.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the fields and currents resulting from a transient VMD source we have two apps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields app:** Models the fields and currents everywhere at a particular time after shutoff\n",
    "- **Data app:** Models the secondary magnetic field observed by the receiver as a function of off-time\n",
